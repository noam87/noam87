&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-stoicism&#34;&gt;On Stoicism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human life the Stoics appear to have considered as a game of great skill; in which, however, there was a mixture of chance [&amp;hellip;] In such games the stake is commonly a trifle, and the whole pleasure of the game arises from playing well, from playing fairly, and playing skilfully. If notwithstanding all his skill, however, the good player should, by the influence of chance, happen to lose, the loss ought to be a matter, rather of merriment, than of serious sorrow. He has made no false stroke; he has done nothing which he ought to be ashamed of; he has enjoyed completely the whole pleasure of the game. [&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our only anxious concern ought to be, not about the stake, but about the proper method of playing. If we placed our happiness in winning the stake, we placed it in what depended upon causes beyond our power, and out of our direction. We necessarily exposed ourselves to perpetual fear and uneasiness, and frequently to grievous and mortifying disappointments. If we placed it in playing well, in playing fairly, in playing wisely and skilfully; in the propriety of our own conduct in short; we placed it in what, by proper discipline, education, and attention, might be altogether in our own power, and under our own direction. Our happiness was perfectly secure, and beyond the reach of fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it courage to, or incapacity not-to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creative person has the courage to experience opposites of his nature and to attempt some reconciliation of them in an individuated expression of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>The Enemy Of You Enemy</title>
      <link>http://noamswebsite.com/r/enemy/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the enemy of your enemy is your friend, then by the transitive property, if any of your enemies are enemies, you are your enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless the friend of your enemy is not your enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Trudge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Soon you&amp;rsquo;ll be dead, and this might cross your mind: that there were two
principal aims toward which you could have aspired:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the world as fully as is possible to you, given your natural limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To feel as good as possible, as often as possible, and experience as much as there is to be experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly the two exist in a sort of opposition, so that the pursuit of one to a
high enough degree seriously hinders one&amp;rsquo;s capacity for pursuing the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But worse still, there&amp;rsquo;s this unctuous mire one is made to trudge through, if
one wishes to pursue either at all: that of societal obligations &amp;ndash; not social
obligations, of which there&amp;rsquo;s only one, and it&amp;rsquo;s to not be terrible to the
others &amp;ndash; but the type that swallow up one&amp;rsquo;s days and take over our minds, this
assault of rituals, that turns our life into noise, casting the pursuit of
either principal aims to the stuff of  Sundays and tired evenings and nights;
relegated to the status of half-dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
