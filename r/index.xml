      <title>Beliefs Vs Conclusions</title>
      <link>http://noamswebsite.com/r/conclusions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;belief&lt;/strong&gt; is axiomatic. It&amp;rsquo;s what one holds to be true. They are at the core
of our interpretation of the world around us, and our understanding of what is
&amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with mathematical axioms, beliefs are by necessity
arbitrary. Whether one asserts with certainty &amp;ldquo;Freedom is desirable&amp;rdquo; or
&amp;ldquo;Subjugation is justified&amp;rdquo; in the end comes down to choosing to believe so (Even
if the first is further derived from the belief that &amp;ldquo;Suffering in others is
bad&amp;rdquo;, that in itself must be arbitrarily asserted, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;, as the name implies, is some terminal point at the end of a
chain of logical assertions, ultimately stemming from one&amp;rsquo;s beliefs, and
whatever information is available to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it goes without saying: whatever information &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; available to one at all
times is incomplete or incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the same information, but different beliefs, two individuals will arrive
at different conclusions; each conclusion being perfectly logical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose your axioms carefully!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the same beliefs, but different subsets of all of the information about a
subject, two individuals will arrive, again logically, at different conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reconsider your conclusions always. Ask: what would I have concluded had &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;
unknown been such and such? Or, what would I have concluded if I were to believe
&lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From studying the mathematical foundations of logic we know that, by playing and
combining competing sets of axioms (and even logics themselves), and arriving at
(sometimes contradictory) conclusions, we gain a richer understanding of the
&amp;ldquo;truths&amp;rdquo; that exist within the mathematical spectrum&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, one must be careful not to fool oneself into believing one has, or is
capable of arriving at a &amp;ldquo;Truth&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Even if such one exists, can it even be
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del&#39;s_incompleteness_theorems&#34;&gt;formulated&lt;/a&gt;?
Can such a formulation be trusted? It&amp;rsquo;s turtles all the way down.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One&amp;rsquo;s beliefs and conclusions, even if &amp;ldquo;logically&amp;rdquo; formulated, at any given
time, even if one can suspend all belief and assume to possess all relevant
information, even then all we can aspire for is that our cherished conclusions
be, at best, one of many equally valid readings of the &amp;ldquo;Truth&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to go about, if one desires not to go completely mad, is to pick
one, or a few, and be mindful that each one of these is simply one more way of
further enriching our flavor of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    At the same time, thinking too much about the philosophical and existential
    implications of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)&#34;&gt;mathematical
    formalism&lt;/a&gt;
    is bound to drive one absolutely mad. &lt;em&gt;Caveat emptor&lt;/em&gt;!
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Political Views</title>
      <link>http://noamswebsite.com/r/political_views/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://noamswebsite.com/r/political_views/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an attempt to succinctly state my political views.
My beliefs will be inherently arbitrary, and my conclusions inevitably based
on incomplete or false knowledge &amp;ndash; however we are all political beings, and
should at the very least be held responsible to understand &lt;em&gt;ourselves&lt;/em&gt; as
such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean by &amp;ldquo;belief&amp;rdquo; is explained &lt;a href=&#34;http://noamswebsite.com/r/conclusions/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was pressed to categorize myself as subscribing to some political creed, I
guess I&amp;rsquo;m something like a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism&#34;&gt;libertarian socialist&lt;/a&gt;,
though I certainly part ways here when it comes to their notion that abolishing
the state altogether is somehow desirable (even if it &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; a possibility that
exists anywhere outside the pipe-dreams of anarchists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political theorists who have influenced me most are
&lt;a href=&#34;http://noamswebsite.com/q/john_stuart_mill/&#34;&gt;John Stuart Mill&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky&#34;&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://noamswebsite.com/q/hannah_arendt/&#34;&gt;Hannah Arendt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest to me at the moment is the Rojava experiment, and the
post-incarceration writings of Abdullah Öcalan on his political theory of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Confederalism&#34;&gt;democratic confederalism&lt;/a&gt;.
His short book on the matter is available as a free PDF
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freeocalan.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Ocalan-Democratic-Confederalism.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Whether Öcalan and the Rojava experiment will succeed in their putative
goals, and the sincerity of those goals, remains to be seen; but one must admire
the extent to which this vision is being put to practice; and the writings are
both refreshing and real-world applicable.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a socialist in the sense that I believe any defensible political system must
strive to minimize excessive suffering and coercion and provide some level of
comfort given the resources that are available to it as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a staunch individualist in the sense that I believe that ideal political
systems are those that allow the individual to flourish, and to experience life,
by his own terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this stems my complete rejection of not only right-wing libertarianism,
but also radical egalitarianism: they are both antithetical to individuality
(one by means of coercion or marginalization, the other by means of
extinguishing individuality altogether!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Here the notion of &amp;ldquo;individual&amp;rdquo; can be extended to groups of individuals,
cultures, and peoples. With this addendum the question naturally arises on the
perils of ascribing &amp;ldquo;personhood&amp;rdquo; to collectives: the privileges of which must
not to dwarf those of the individual person.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a funny contradiction with supposed anti-authoritarians who revel in the
chaos of mobs: what more intractably illegitimate form of authority exists
than that of a mob?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sweep</title>
      <link>http://noamswebsite.com/r/sweep/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://noamswebsite.com/r/sweep/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was on my regular afternoon bike ride when I noticed a crowd of people
sweeping the walkways. I leaned my bike on a tree and  went to the first man and
asked &amp;ldquo;Why do you sweep?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I sweep because I resign,&amp;rdquo; he said to me.&amp;ldquo;I used to go blue in the face with
how dirty these streets were. But it was no use, they paid no attention, and I
would go mad each day when upon arriving I would dirty my carpet. I swear I was
losing my mind. I would shout and complain and nobody did a damn thing. Finally
I resigned to the situation. And I was struck by a notion, that only one thing
was within my reach to do, and I got myself this broom and since then I keep my
head down and sweep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And what if another walks on your path and muddies it again?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then I sweep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thanked the man and went on to the next one and asked &amp;ldquo;Why do you sweep?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I sweep because someone has to. I always suspected these streets were not as
clean as they could be, but none would have it,&amp;rdquo; he answered, then looked both
ways to check if anyone was eavesdropping before adding &amp;ldquo;downright dirty,
actually &amp;ndash; and then one day I saw that man over there sweeping. So I got a
broom and started sweeping too.&amp;rdquo; He paused for a moment, tired, then looked at
me again with pride: &amp;ldquo;Look how clean my walkway is!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, I asked another group of people, further down the crowd why they
swept: &amp;ldquo;Well, we sweep because it&amp;rsquo;s proper,&amp;rdquo; answered one. &amp;ldquo;We saw those over
there doing it, and it seemed like a good enough thing to do to join in. The
streets are much cleaner now, don&amp;rsquo;t you see?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked further into the crowd, some were sweeping more vigorously than others,
but even the lazy ones stood with brooms in their hands and talked of how much
they loved to sweep, and again I asked one &amp;ldquo;Why do you sweep?&amp;rdquo; and he said &amp;ldquo;We
sweep because everyone sweeps. How else do you think these streets would stay so
clean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a little further down, I asked again and one said to me simply &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve always
swept.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last I was lost in the crowd completely, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make out my bike or the
tree in the distance at all. I looked around me and tapped one of the sweeping
men on the shoulder.  &amp;ldquo;Why do you sweep?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a moment he looked at me as if I was strange, then he paused, and a look of
worry came to his face &amp;ndash; it was as if he&amp;rsquo;d not even realized he had been
sweeping all this time! The mere question had snapped him out of a trance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he was struck by a notion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it courage to, or incapacity not-to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creative person has the courage to experience opposites of his nature and to attempt some reconciliation of them in an individuated expression of himself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was at the lake last Summer. I picked a mossy old bench to sit, when a group
of adolescents gathered to throw stones into the water.  For an hour they busied
around, making loud gestures and arguing over whose stone made the bigger
splash.  They would try every angle, and then bicker about which one spattered
out the widest, or which one sent the water flying the highest, and how could
they agree on what they&amp;rsquo;d seen if in a moment it was gone? Finally they
approached me hoping I would settle their dispute, but I&amp;rsquo;d not seen the water
splash&amp;ndash; they scoffed, frustrated, and went on their way, and I was free to
continue watching the ripples that now adorned the surface of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
