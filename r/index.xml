      <description>Video Talks  Justice: What&amp;rsquo;s the Right Thing To Do?. Amazing Harvard lecture series on Ethics that got me into the subject. Robert Sapolsky: The Biology of Human Behavior. Stanford lecture series. Are you in control of your decisions and personality? Maybe not as much as you think. Everything is a Remix. &amp;ldquo;There be nothing new, but that which is Hath been before&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (Free) documentary on the history of stealing ideas, and how the current reinterpretation of IP / copyright laws stand in the way of innovation, not help it.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something about learning from a physical object that makes things &amp;ldquo;click&amp;rdquo; better in my head (it has volume, texture; a particular smell); and I doubt I&amp;rsquo;m an oddity in this respect &amp;ndash; the root of this effect may be biological: For example, when recalling some piece of information, often I can remember where &amp;ndash; within some textbook I read half a decade ago &amp;ndash; the subject is explained. And I do mean, a literal, physical &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rdquo;: a page, (a thing,) which at all times can be found tucked somewhere within a physical stack of bound paper, which I can touch and feel; I might even remember where I was sitting (or standing, or lying), as I held that particular book, open at that page, when I studied the subject, and what it felt like to the touch, and how the lighting in the room fell on the paper; maybe I jotted some note on the margin, maybe I spilled tea on the pages before, giving that &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rdquo; its own unique irregular texture and color &amp;ndash; all of which my brain will forever associate with that information.</description>
