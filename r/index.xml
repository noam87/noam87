      <title>Beliefs Vs Conclusions</title>
      <link>http://noamswebsite.com/r/conclusions/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://noamswebsite.com/r/conclusions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;strong&gt;beliefs&lt;/strong&gt; are axiomatic. They are at the core of how you interpret the
world around you and your understanding of what is &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;. But just as with
mathematical axioms, beliefs are arbitrary &amp;ndash; they are not supported by facts
and logic, but rather color our interpretation of facts. Whether you believe
&amp;ldquo;Freedom is desirable&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Subjugation is justified&amp;rdquo; in the end comes down to
choosing to believe so (Even if the first is further derived from the belief
that &amp;ldquo;Suffering in others is bad&amp;rdquo;, that in itself must be arbitrarily asserted,
and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;conclusions&lt;/strong&gt; you form on the other hand are not arbitrary. As the name
implies, they represent some terminal point at the end of a chain of logical
assertions, ultimately stemming from your beliefs, the quality of your logic,
and whatever information is available to you at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it goes without saying: whatever information &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; available to you is
incomplete or incorrect, make no mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes your beliefs can feel like conclusions: you may convince yourself you
have arrived at some belief out of careful deliberation, when in reality you&amp;rsquo;ve
worked the conclusion backwards, merely stringing together facts that support
your chosen belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the same information, but different beliefs, you and a friend might arrive
at different conclusions; each conclusion being perfectly logical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose your axioms carefully!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the same beliefs, but access to different information, you and your friend
might again conclude differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask not only &amp;ldquo;Is my logic sound?&amp;rdquo;: what would I have concluded had &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; unknown
been such and such? Or, what would I have concluded if I were to believe &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;
instead of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By playing and combining competing sets of axioms (and even logics themselves),
and arriving at (sometimes contradictory) theorems, mathematicians have gained a
richer understanding of the &amp;ldquo;truths&amp;rdquo; that exist within the mathematical
spectrum&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ndash; but none is more &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;: don&amp;rsquo;t fool yourself into believing you have, or are
capable of arriving at a &amp;ldquo;The Truth&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Even if such one exists, the question here is: can it even be
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del&#39;s_incompleteness_theorems&#34;&gt;formulated&lt;/a&gt;?
Can such a formulation be trusted? It&amp;rsquo;s turtles all the way down!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your beliefs and conclusions, even if &amp;ldquo;logically&amp;rdquo; formulated, even if you
suspend all belief and assume you possess all relevant information, even then
all you can aspire to is that your conclusions be one of many equally valid
ways of coloring &amp;ldquo;Truth&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to go about, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go completely mad, is to pick a few,
and be mindful that each one of these is just one more way of further enriching
the limited flavor of reality that was assigned to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    At the same time, thinking too much about the philosophical and existential
    implications of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)&#34;&gt;mathematical
    formalism&lt;/a&gt;
    is bound to drive you absolutely mad. &lt;em&gt;Caveat emptor&lt;/em&gt;!
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a funny contradiction with supposed anti-authoritarians who revel in the
chaos of mobs: what more intractably illegitimate form of authority exists
than that of a mob?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sweep</title>
      <link>http://noamswebsite.com/r/sweep/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://noamswebsite.com/r/sweep/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was on my regular afternoon bike ride when I noticed a crowd of people
sweeping the walkways. I leaned my bike on a tree and  went to the first man and
asked &amp;ldquo;Why do you sweep?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I sweep because I resign,&amp;rdquo; he said to me.&amp;ldquo;I used to go blue in the face with
how dirty these streets were. But it was no use, they paid no attention, and I
would go mad each day when upon arriving I would dirty my carpet. I swear I was
losing my mind. I would shout and complain and nobody did a damn thing. Finally
I resigned to the situation. And I was struck by a notion, that only one thing
was within my reach to do, and I got myself this broom and since then I keep my
head down and sweep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And what if another walks on your path and muddies it again?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then I sweep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thanked the man and went on to the next one and asked &amp;ldquo;Why do you sweep?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I sweep because someone has to. I always suspected these streets were not as
clean as they could be, but none would have it,&amp;rdquo; he answered, then looked both
ways to check if anyone was eavesdropping before adding &amp;ldquo;downright dirty,
actually &amp;ndash; and then one day I saw that man over there sweeping. So I got a
broom and started sweeping too.&amp;rdquo; He paused for a moment, tired, then looked at
me again with pride: &amp;ldquo;Look how clean my walkway is!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, I asked another group of people, further down the crowd why they
swept: &amp;ldquo;Well, we sweep because it&amp;rsquo;s proper,&amp;rdquo; answered one. &amp;ldquo;We saw those over
there doing it, and it seemed like a good enough thing to do to join in. The
streets are much cleaner now, don&amp;rsquo;t you see?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked further into the crowd, some were sweeping more vigorously than others,
but even the lazy ones stood with brooms in their hands and talked of how much
they loved to sweep, and again I asked one &amp;ldquo;Why do you sweep?&amp;rdquo; and he said &amp;ldquo;We
sweep because everyone sweeps. How else do you think these streets would stay so
clean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a little further down, I asked again and one said to me simply &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve always
swept.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last I was lost in the crowd completely, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make out my bike or the
tree in the distance at all. I looked around me and tapped one of the sweeping
men on the shoulder.  &amp;ldquo;Why do you sweep?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a moment he looked at me as if I was strange, then he paused, and a look of
worry came to his face &amp;ndash; it was as if he&amp;rsquo;d not even realized he had been
sweeping all this time! The mere question had snapped him out of a trance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he was struck by a notion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it courage to, or incapacity not-to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creative person has the courage to experience opposites of his nature and to attempt some reconciliation of them in an individuated expression of himself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Enemy Of Your Enemy</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the enemy of your enemy is your friend, then by the transitive property, if any of your enemies are enemies, you are your enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless the friend of your enemy is not your enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Stones</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was at the lake last Summer. I picked a mossy old bench to sit, when a group
of adolescents gathered to throw stones into the water.  For an hour they busied
around, making loud gestures and arguing over whose stone made the bigger
splash.  They would try every angle, and then bicker about which one spattered
out the widest, or which one sent the water flying the highest, and how could
they agree on what they&amp;rsquo;d seen if in a moment it was gone? Finally they
approached me hoping I would settle their dispute, but I&amp;rsquo;d not seen the water
splash&amp;ndash; they scoffed, frustrated, and went on their way, and I was free to
continue watching the ripples that now adorned the surface of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
