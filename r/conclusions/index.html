				<p>A <strong>belief</strong> is axiomatic. It&rsquo;s what one holds to be true. They are at the core
of our interpretation of the world around us, and our understanding of what is
&ldquo;true&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At the same time, as with mathematical axioms, beliefs are by necessity
arbitrary. Whether one asserts with certainty &ldquo;Freedom is desirable&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Subjugation is justified&rdquo; in the end comes down to choosing to believe so (Even
if the first is further derived from the belief that &ldquo;Suffering in others is
bad&rdquo;, that in itself must be arbitrarily asserted, and so on).</p>

<p>A <strong>conclusion</strong>, as the name implies, is some terminal point at the end of a
chain of logical assertions, ultimately stemming from one&rsquo;s beliefs, and
whatever information is available to us.</p>

<p>And it goes without saying: whatever information <em>is</em> available to one at all
times is incomplete or incorrect.</p>

<hr />

<p>Given the same information, but different beliefs, two individuals will arrive
at different conclusions; each conclusion being perfectly logical.</p>

<p>Choose your axioms carefully!</p>

<hr />

<p>Given the same beliefs, but different subsets of all of the information about a
subject, two individuals will arrive, again logically, at different conclusions.</p>

<p>Reconsider your conclusions always. Ask: what would I have concluded had <code>x</code>
unknown been such and such? Or, what would I have concluded if I were to believe
<code>B</code> instead of <code>A</code>?</p>

<hr />

<p>From studying the mathematical foundations of logic we know that, by playing and
combining competing sets of axioms (and even logics themselves), and arriving at
(sometimes contradictory) conclusions, we gain a richer understanding of the
&ldquo;truths&rdquo; that exist within the mathematical spectrum<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>As such, one must be careful not to fool oneself into believing one has, or is
capable of arriving at a &ldquo;Truth&rdquo;.</p>

<p>(Even if such one exists, can it even be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems">formulated</a>?
Can such a formulation be trusted? It&rsquo;s turtles all the way down.)</p>

<hr />

<p>One&rsquo;s beliefs and conclusions, even if &ldquo;logically&rdquo; formulated, at any given
time, even if one can suspend all belief and assume to possess all relevant
information, even then all we can aspire for is that our cherished conclusions
be, at best, one many equally valid readings of the &ldquo;Truth&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The best way to go about, if one desires not to go completely mad, is to pick
one, or a few, and be mindful that each one of these is simply one more way of
further enriching our flavor of reality.</p>

<p>&hellip; I think.</p>

    At the same, thinking too much about the philosophical and existential
    implications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)">mathematical
    formalism</a>
    is bound to drive one absolutely mad. <em>Caveat emptor</em>!
