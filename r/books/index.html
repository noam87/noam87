				<p>There&rsquo;s something about learning from a physical object that makes things
&ldquo;click&rdquo; better in my head (it has volume, texture; a particular smell); and I
doubt I&rsquo;m an oddity in this respect &ndash; the root of this effect may be
biological: For example, when recalling some piece of information, often I can
remember where &ndash; within some textbook I read half a decade ago &ndash; the subject
is explained. And I do mean, a literal, <em>physical</em> &ldquo;where&rdquo;: a page, (a
<em>thing</em>,) which at all times can be found tucked somewhere within a physical
stack of bound paper, which I can touch and feel; I might even remember where I
was sitting (or standing, or lying), as I held that particular book, open at
that page, when I studied the subject, and what it felt like to the touch, and
how the lighting in the room fell on the paper; maybe I jotted some note on the
margin, maybe I spilled tea on the pages before, giving that &ldquo;where&rdquo; its own
unique irregular texture and color &ndash; all of which my brain will forever
associate with that information. Digital can&rsquo;t do any of that.</p>

<p>In this sense, there is nothing left to improve about the physical book.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if once I open this book I find myself confused, (maybe
because the book was written by a guy named named Spivak, who does not like to
explain what happens in between those little &ldquo;=&rdquo; symbols,) I can&rsquo;t press on
anything and expect it to expand magically and reveal more detail. It&rsquo;s at this
point that I will turn to my laptop, and search for more information, maybe
even ask a stranger half a world away, or watch an interactive video. My copy
of &ldquo;Calculus on Manifolds&rdquo; can&rsquo;t do any of that.</p>

<p>So even though ebooks do offer some perks, in many ways the printed book
remains superior. <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/business/media/the-plot-twist-e-book-sales-slip-and-print-is-far-from-dead.html">I
think it&rsquo;s a safe bet that books aren&rsquo;t going anywhere</a>. Radio did not
replace print, TV did not replace radio. (Interactive did not replace passive;
print did not replace the spoken word.) Each of these media is better suited
for different tasks.</p>

<p>(I also still find that the best way to solve a problem (even a programming
problem), is with pen and paper. Physically jotting down an idea beats pressing
buttons while staring at an obnoxious, headache-inducing glowing screen any
time (which I try to avoid as much as possible, even as a software developer).
To me flipping pages still beats searching and clicking &ndash; what a dreadful user
experience is a digital textbook!)</p>
