			<div>
				<p>An attempt to succinctly state my political beliefs and conclusions. My beliefs
will be inherently arbitrary, and my conclusions inevitably based on incomplete
or false knowledge &ndash; however we are all political beings, and should at the
very least be held responsible to understand <em>ourselves</em> as such.</p>

<p>What I mean by &ldquo;belief&rdquo; and &ldquo;conclusion&rdquo; is explained <a href="/r/conclusions/">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>If I were pressed to categorize myself as holding some political creed, I would
guess I am something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">libertarian
socialist</a>, though I
certainly part ways here when it comes to their notion that abolishing the state
altogether is somehow desirable (even if it <em>were</em> a possibility that exists
anywhere outside the pipe-dreams of anarchists).</p>

<p>The political theorists who have influenced me most are
<a href="/q/john_stuart_mill/">John Stuart Mill</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, and
<a href="/q/hannah_arendt/">Hannah Arendt</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Of particular interest to me at the moment is the Rojava experiment, and the
post-incarceration writings of Abdullah Öcalan on his political theory of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Confederalism">democratic confederalism</a>.
His short book on the matter is available as a free PDF
<a href="http://www.freeocalan.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Ocalan-Democratic-Confederalism.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>(Whether the Öcalan and the Rojava experiment will succeed in their putative
goals, and the sincerity of those goals, remains to be seen; but one must admire
the extent to which this vision is being put to practice; and the writings are
refreshing.)</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m a socialist in the sense that I believe any defensible political system must
strive to minimize excessive suffering and coercion and provide some level of
comfort given the resources that are available to it as a whole.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m a staunch individualist in the sense that I believe that the ideal political
systems are those which allows the individual to flourish, by his own means, and
to experience life by his own terms.</p>

<p>From this stems my complete rejection of not only right-wing libertarianism,
but also radical egalitarianism: they are both antithetical to individuality
(one by means of coercion or marginalization, the other by means of
extinguishing individuality altogether!)</p>

<p>(Here the notion of individuals can be extended to groups of individuals,
cultures, and peoples. With this addendum the question naturally arises on the
perils of ascribing &ldquo;personhood&rdquo; to collectives: the privileges of which must be
checked at all times not to dwarf those of the individual.)</p>
