<h2 id="on-the-effectiveness-of-bad-men">On The Effectiveness Of Bad Men</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more
effectively than have the people of good will.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-purpose-of-nonviolent-direct-action">The Purpose Of Nonviolent Direct Action</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I must confess that I am not afraid of the word &ldquo;tension.&rdquo; I have earnestly
opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent
tension which is necessary for growth.</p>

<p>You may well ask: &ldquo;Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth?
Isn&rsquo;t negotiation a better path?&rdquo; You are quite right in calling for
negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. <strong>Nonviolent
direct action seeks to create such a crisis</strong> and foster such a tension that a
community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the
issue.</p>

<p>The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis
packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore
concur with you in your call for negotiation.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of
tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already
alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="white-moderates">White Moderates</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed
with the white moderate. <strong>I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion
that the Negro&rsquo;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not
the White Citizen&rsquo;s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate,
who is more devoted to &ldquo;order&rdquo; than to justice;</strong> who prefers a negative
peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the
presence of justice; who constantly says: &ldquo;I agree with you in the goal you
seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action&rdquo;; who
paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man&rsquo;s
freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises
the Negro to wait for a &ldquo;more convenient season.&rdquo; <strong>Shallow understanding
from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding
from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than
outright rejection.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="waiting-for-society-to-change">Waiting For Society To Change</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil
rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an
historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges
voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up
their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, <strong>groups tend
to be more immoral than individuals.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="when-is-the-appropriate-time-to-disrupt">When Is The Appropriate Time To Disrupt?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was &ldquo;well
timed&rdquo; in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of
segregation. For years now I have heard the word &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; It rings in the ear
of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This &ldquo;Wait&rdquo; has almost always meant
&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="breaking-the-law">Breaking The Law</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is
unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to
arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality
expressing the highest respect for law.</p>
