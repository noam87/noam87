<p><strong>THIS IS A POOPOO DRAFT</strong></p>

<p>Excerpts and notes from Mill&rsquo;s <em>On Liberty</em>. Some are in the form of a
question-and-answer dialogue to address common misconceptions about free speech.</p>

<p>In part my goal is to help dispel the idea that free speech advocates are all
afflicted by a sort of romantic naivete, foolishly holding on to sentimental
notions of man&rsquo;s &ldquo;natural right&rdquo; to speak, or are blind to the paradoxical
threats that arise from &ldquo;providing aggressors with a platform to spread hate&rdquo; &ndash;
sentiments popularized for example in cartoons like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/fs_1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Quite opposite: far from naive, at the root of the utilitarian
conception of free speech lies a cynical view of human nature and the limits of
man&rsquo;s capacity for making sound moral judgement.</p>

<p>(<em>On Liberty</em> in its entirety is available here for free here:
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm)">https://www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm)</a></p>

<p>Before we explore the intricacies of his essay, let&rsquo;s address the most basic
question:</p>

<h2 id="q-what-are-the-main-reasons-for-protecting-free-speech">Q: What are the main reasons for protecting free speech?</h2>

<p>JS Mill presents the reader with four principal arguments.  Note that at no
point does he moralize on man&rsquo;s natural right to free expression, romantic
notions of &ldquo;Truth&rdquo;, or anything of the sort: Mill is solely concerned about the
far-reaching societal consequences of impeding dissent. The four arguments are
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>First,</strong> if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we
can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is pretty straightforward: we are all flawed; by silencing
those we believe to be in error we may inadvertently silence someone who holds
a valid opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Secondly,</strong> though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly
does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion
on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision
of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being
supplied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we enter slightly more subtle territory: even if one is mostly right, it
is rare that one is <em>wholly</em> right; and similarly, there is often a grain of
truth to be found even in the opinion of those who are mostly wrong. Mill
argues that it&rsquo;s only by allowing the two viewpoints to clash that we can
separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>His two final arguments are often overlooked in discussions of free speech,
though they are vital &ndash; their implications are also rather counterintuitive,
so they must be considered carefully:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thirdly,</strong> even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth;
unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and earnestly
contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of
a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds. And
not only this, but, <strong>fourthly,</strong> the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in
danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the
character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mere formal profession,
inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of
any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, dissent must be encouraged not only to correct popular opinions that
are wrong, but to preserve popular opinions that are right; because when
they become mere dogma, they run the risk of being lost or perverted.</p>

<p>Failure to understand arguments 3 and 4 are, I believe, at the core of modern
polemic surrounding free speech and the &ldquo;no platform&rdquo; movement. Thus we end up
with absurd situations in which, for example, children&rsquo;s authors who write
cautionary tales of racism <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2017/08/the-toxic-drama-of-ya-twitter.html">are instead accused of promoting
it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="on-dissent">On Dissent</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>When there are persons to be found, who form an exception to the apparent
unanimity of the world on any subject, even if the world is in the right, it
is always probable that dissentients have something worth hearing to say for
themselves, and that truth would lose something by their silence.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="q-what-about-bigots-why-should-we-let-them-speak-why-listen-to-what-they-have-to-say">Q: What about bigots: why should we let them speak? Why listen to what they have to say?</h2>

<p>Mill warns us multiple times to not become a public who has&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never thrown themselves into the mental position of those who think
differently from them, and considered what such persons may have to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He goes on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The greatest orator of antiquity has left it on record that he always studied
his adversary&rsquo;s case with as great, if not with still greater, intensity than
even his own. What Cicero practised as the means of forensic success,
requires to be imitated by all who study any subject in order to arrive at
the truth. <strong>He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of
that.</strong> His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute
them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite
side; if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for
preferring either opinion. The rational position for him would be suspension
of judgment, and unless he contents himself with that, he is either led by
authority, or adopts, like the generality of the world, the side to which he
feels most inclination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His next observation is essential:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nor is it enough that he should hear the arguments of adversaries from his
own teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by what they
offer as refutations.</strong> That is not the way to do justice to the arguments,
or bring them into real contact with his own mind.  He must be able to hear
them from persons who actually believe them; who defend them in earnest, and
do their very utmost for them. He must know them in their most plausible and
persuasive form; he must feel the whole force of the difficulty which the
true view of the subject has to encounter and dispose of; <strong>else he will never
really possess himself of the portion of truth which meets and removes that
difficulty.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage serves to highlight a major failing from our educators and
political writers, who so liberally bastardize unfavorable views
and weaken their arguments to make them seem less persuasive, leaving the
audience with the false impression that good morality is self-evident.</p>

<p>Good morals are far from self-evident. It is not self-evident that slavery is
wrong; it is not self-evident that anyone has a right to exist; nor is it
self-evident that we are all entitled to equal treatment under the law.</p>

<p>Similarly, far from being stupid and self-evidently nasty, fascism is a
powerful, persuasive ideology that continues to lure bright minds to this day,
and under the right conditions, if unchecked, spreads like wildfire &ndash;
precisely <em>because</em> it is so effective.</p>

<p>To teach our students otherwise is to rob them of the intellectual tools they
need to defend their own liberties. It&rsquo;s embarrassing to watch YouTube videos
of Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos talk circles around stammering, babbling
university students who can scarcely string together pertinent questions, let
alone a cogent defense of their own position &ndash; having clearly never been
properly exposed to an opposite view.</p>

<p>Compare today&rsquo;s dogmatic, rhetoric-laden performances from progressive
moralists with <a href="https://youtu.be/9DvmLMUfGss">this old clip</a> of Noam
Chomsky<sup>1</sup> deftly standing his ground against every rhetorical trick
and &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; William Buckley throws at him.  Aren&rsquo;t we all better off that he
didn&rsquo;t just sit in his chair for the duration of the program chanting &ldquo;This is
what white supremacy looks like&rdquo;?</p>

<p>So vital is exposure to dissent to our understanding, that Mill goes one step
further, and recommends that whenever a dissenting opinion is not available, we
should invent it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So essential is this discipline to a real understanding of moral and human
subjects, that if opponents of all important truths do not exist, it is
indispensable to imagine them, and supply them with the strongest arguments
which the most skilful devil&rsquo;s advocate can conjure up.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><small>
  1. Chomsky&rsquo;s commitment to this principle is best exemplified by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faurisson_affair">his defense
     of a Holocaust denier</a> in
     the late 70&rsquo;s.
</small></p>

<h2 id="q-some-things-should-not-be-up-for-debate-do-we-really-need-to-question-moral-truths-that-have-long-been-settled">Q: Some things should not be up for debate. Do we really need to question moral truths that have long been settled?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>How often, when smarting under some unforeseen misfortune or disappointment,
does a person call to mind some proverb or common saying, familiar to him all
his life, the meaning of which, if he had ever before felt it as he does now,
would have saved him from the calamity. There are indeed reasons for this,
other than the absence of discussion: there are many truths of which the full
meaning cannot be realised, until personal experience has brought it home.
But much more of the meaning even of these would have been understood, and
what was understood would have been far more deeply impressed on the mind, if
the man had been accustomed to hear it argued pro and con by people who did
understand it. <strong>The fatal tendency of mankind to leave off thinking about a
thing when it is no longer doubtful, is the cause of half their errors.</strong> A
contemporary author<sup>1</sup> has well spoken of &ldquo;the deep slumber of a
decided opinion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On multiple instances, Mill illustrates this paradox in different forms: by
consecrating certain moral principles and hard-earned liberties, by declaring
them beyond questioning, far from protecting them we rob them of their urgency
and weaken them.</p>

<hr />

<p><small>
    1. The author in question is Arthur Helps.
</small></p>

<h2 id="q-isn-t-it-naive-to-think-that-you-can-change-a-bigot-s-mind-by-debating-them">Q: Isn&rsquo;t it naive to think that you can change a bigot&rsquo;s mind by debating them?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I acknowledge that the tendency of all opinions to become sectarian is not
cured by the freest discussion, but is often heightened and exacerbated
thereby; the truth which ought to have been, but was not, seen, being
rejected all the more violently because proclaimed by persons regarded as
opponents. But <strong>it is not on the impassioned partisan, it is on the calmer
and more disinterested bystander, that this collision of opinions works its
salutary effect.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When debating a racist, whether in public life or in an academic setting, your
goal is not to convince the racist. Instead keep in mind that every debate has
an audience; this audience will encompass a wide spectrum of persuasions and
experiences. Being exposed to a well-presented counterargument could be the
catalyst that sets someone to question their beliefs.</p>

<p>Back in 2010 I went down to the US for Jon Stewart&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_to_Restore_Sanity_and/or_Fear">Rally To Restore
Sanity</a>
and invited someone I knew down there to come with me. They&rsquo;re not a
particularly political person, but I thought it would be a fun experience for
them. The speeches were the usual sort of tame liberal banter I&rsquo;d think
nothing much of, growing up with two activist parents. Anyway, halfway through
the monologue I remember my friend turned to me, wide eyed, and said &ldquo;Wow!
I&rsquo;d never thought of it that way! &ndash; <strong>I&rsquo;ve never heard people say things like
that!</strong>&ldquo;</p>

<p>Wherever we go we are ambassadors of our moral convictions &ndash; our actions, and
more importantly how they are perceived, may be the only point of reference for
an outsider &ndash; someone who&rsquo;s never been exposed to our point of view,
<em>because they never had a reason to</em>. As viscerally satisfying as it is to tar
and feather opponents and kick them out of town, we must always be wary of
setting up ideological ghettos where hate and resentment can only fester and
grow.</p>

<h2 id="q-but-there-are-toxic-people-who-wish-to-cause-real-harm">Q: But there are toxic people who wish to cause real harm!</h2>

<p><img src="/img/fs_2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Mill presents us with the following hypothetical example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This last proviso is of course indispensable. No one pretends that actions
should be as free as opinions. On the contrary, <strong>even opinions lose their
immunity, when the circumstances in which they are expressed are such as to
constitute their expression a positive instigation to some mischievous act.</strong>
An opinion that corn-dealers are starvers of the poor, or that private
property is robbery, ought to be unmolested when simply circulated through
the press, but may justly incur punishment when delivered orally to an
excited mob assembled before the house of a corn-dealer, or when handed about
among the same mob in the form of a placard.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="q-aren-t-there-cases-where-an-opinion-is-obviously-wrong">Q: Aren&rsquo;t there cases where an opinion is obviously wrong?</h2>

<p>Obvious to whom?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While every one well knows himself to be fallible, few think it necessary to
take any precautions against their own fallibility, or admit the supposition
that any opinion, of which they feel very certain, may be one of the examples
of the error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whom would you trust with the authority of deciding what should and should not
be valid opinion? Whom would you let decide which established opinions should
and should not be questioned?</p>

<p>What we are being pointed to here is another moral paradox: by its very nature, at
the heart of every censor lies a dangerous sort of hubris, the very which
should make them ineligible for the task:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The opinion which it is attempted to suppress by authority may
possibly be true. Those who desire to suppress it, of course deny its truth;
but they are not infallible. <strong>They have no authority to decide the question
for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the means of judging.</strong>
To refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are sure that it is false, is
to assume that their certainty is the same thing as absolute certainty. <strong>All
silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="q-but-surely-sometimes-the-public-passion-is-so-strong-that-the-truth-cannot-be-denied">Q: But surely, sometimes the public passion is so strong, that the truth cannot be denied?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a piece of idle sentimentality that truth, merely as truth, has any
inherent power denied to error, of prevailing against the dungeon and the
stake. Men are not more zealous for truth than they often are for error, and
<strong>a sufficient application of legal or even of social penalties will
generally succeed in stopping the propagation of either.</strong></p>

<p>The real advantage which truth has, consists in this, that when an opinion is
true, it may be extinguished once, twice, or many times, but in the course of
ages there will generally be found persons to rediscover it, until some one
of its reappearances falls on a time when from favourable circumstances it
escapes persecution until it has made such head as to withstand all
subsequent attempts to suppress it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="q-but-what-if-i-m-wrong">Q: But what if I&rsquo;m wrong?</h2>

<p>And most importantly, allow yourself (and others) to be wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Truth gains more even by the errors of one who, with due study and
preparation, thinks for himself, than by the true opinions of those who only
hold them because they do not suffer themselves to think.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="political-theory-vs-the-real-world">Political Theory Vs The Real World</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>But, in political and philosophical theories, as well as in persons, success
discloses faults and infirmities which failure might have concealed from
observation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="liberty-as-social-value-not-merely-law">Liberty As Social Value, Not Merely Law</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong
mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it
ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many
kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such
extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more
deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself. <strong>Protection,
therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough: there needs
protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling;
against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil
penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who
dissent from them;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="social-stigma-more-powerful-than-legal-censorship">Social Stigma More Powerful Than Legal Censorship</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>It is that stigma which is really effective, and so effective is it that the
profession of opinions which are under the ban of society is much less common
in England, than is, in many other countries, the avowal of those which incur
risk of judicial punishment. In respect to all persons but those whose
pecuniary circumstances make them independent of the good will of other
people, opinion, on this subject, is as efficacious as law; men might as well
be imprisoned, as excluded from the means of earning their bread.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>Socrates was put to death, but the Socratic philosophy rose like the sun in
heaven [&hellip;] Christians were cast to the lions, but the Christian church grew
up a stately and spreading tree [&hellip;] Our merely social intolerance kills no
one, roots out no opinions, but induces men to disguise them [&hellip;] With us,
heretical opinions do not perceptibly gain, or even lose, ground [&hellip;] but
continue to smoulder in the narrow circles of thinking and studious persons
among whom they originate, without ever lighting up the general affairs of
mankind with either a true or a deceptive light. [&hellip;] <strong>A state of things in
which a large portion of the most active and inquiring intellects find it
advisable to keep the genuine principles and grounds of their convictions
within their own breasts, and attempt, in what they address to the public, to
fit as much as they can of their own conclusions to premises which they have
internally renounced, cannot send forth the open, fearless characters, and
logical, consistent intellects who once adorned the thinking world.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>But it is not the minds of heretics that are deteriorated most, by the ban
placed on all inquiry which does not end in the orthodox conclusions. The
greatest harm done is to those who are not heretics, and whose whole mental
development is cramped, and their reason cowed, by the fear of heresy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="resurgence-of-religion">Resurgence Of Religion</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>What is boasted of at the present time as the revival of religion, is always,
in narrow and uncultivated minds, at least as much the revival of bigotry;
and where there is the strong permanent leaven of intolerance in the feelings
of a people, which at all times abides in the middle classes of this country,
it needs but little to provoke them into actively persecuting those whom they
have never ceased to think proper objects of persecution.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="incomplete-truths">Incomplete Truths</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>But there is a commoner case than either of these; when the conflicting
doctrines, instead of being one true and the other false, share the truth
between them; and the nonconforming opinion is needed to supply the remainder
of the truth, of which the received doctrine embodies only a part. Popular
opinions, on subjects not palpable to sense, are often true, but seldom or
never the whole truth.</p>

<p>in the human mind, one-sidedness has always been the rule, and many-sidedness
the exception. Hence, <strong>even in revolutions of opinion, one part of the truth
usually sets while another rises. Even progress, which ought to superadd, for
the most part only substitutes one partial and incomplete truth for
another;</strong> improvement consisting chiefly in this, that the new fragment of
truth is more wanted, more adapted to the needs of the time, than that which
it displaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>In politics, again, it is almost a commonplace, that a party of order or
stability, and a party of progress or reform, are both necessary elements of
a healthy state of political life [&hellip;] Each of these modes of thinking
derives its utility from the deficiencies of the other; but it is in a great
measure the opposition of the other that keeps each within the limits of
reason and sanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="don-t-make-a-habit-of-stigmatizing-dissent">Don&rsquo;t Make A Habit Of Stigmatizing Dissent</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The worst offence of this kind which can be committed by a polemic, is to
stigmatise those who hold the contrary opinion as bad and immoral men. To
calumny of this sort, those who hold any unpopular opinion are peculiarly
exposed, because they are in general few and uninfluential, and nobody but
themselves feel much interest in seeing justice done them; but this weapon
is, from the nature of the case, denied to those who attack a prevailing
opinion: they can neither use it with safety to themselves, nor, if they
could, would it do anything but recoil on their own cause. In general,
opinions contrary to those commonly received can only obtain a hearing by
studied moderation of language, and the most cautious avoidance of
unnecessary offence, from which they hardly ever deviate even in a slight
degree without losing ground: while unmeasured vituperation employed on the
side of the prevailing opinion, really does deter people from professing
contrary opinions, and from listening to those who profess them. For the
interest, therefore, of truth and justice, it is far more important to
restrain this employment of vituperative language than the other;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-stifling-of-individuality">The Stifling Of Individuality</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>But the evil is, that individual spontaneity is hardly recognised by the
common modes of thinking, as having any intrinsic worth, or deserving any
regard on its own account. The majority, being satisfied with the ways of
mankind as they now are (for it is they who make them what they are), cannot
comprehend why those ways should not be good enough for everybody.</p>

<p>What is more, spontaneity forms no part of the ideal of the majority of moral
and social reformers, but is rather looked on with jealousy, as a troublesome
and perhaps rebellious obstruction to the general acceptance of what these
reformers, in their own judgment, think would be best for mankind.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="progress-through-experimentation">Progress Through Experimentation</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>As it is useful that while mankind are imperfect there should be different
opinions, so is it that there should be different experiments of living; that
free scope should be given to varieties of character, short of injury to
others; and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved
practically, when any one thinks fit to try them. It is desirable, in short,
that in things which do not primarily concern others, individuality should
assert itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="mediocrity-always-wins">Mediocrity Always Wins</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In sober truth, whatever homage may be professed, or even paid, to real or
supposed mental superiority, the general tendency of things throughout the
world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power among mankind.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>No government by a democracy or a numerous aristocracy, either in its
political acts or in the opinions, qualities, and tone of mind which it
fosters, ever did or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the
sovereign Many have let themselves be guided by the counsels and influence of
a more highly gifted and instructed One or Few. <strong>The initiation of all wise
or noble things, comes and must come from individuals;</strong> generally at first
from some one individual.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<blockquote>
<p>Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has
abounded; and the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been
proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which
it contained. That so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger of
the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="liberty-and-progress-do-not-always-go-hand-in-hand">Liberty And Progress Do Not Always Go Hand In Hand</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The spirit of improvement is not always a spirit of liberty, for it may aim
at forcing improvements on an unwilling people; <strong>and the spirit of liberty,
in so far as it resists such attempts, may ally itself locally and
temporarily with the opponents of improvement;</strong> but the only unfailing and
permanent source of improvement is liberty, since by it there are as many
possible independent centres of improvement as there are individuals.</p>
