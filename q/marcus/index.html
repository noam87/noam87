<p>Selections from his meditations (Available
<a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html">here</a> for free. One of
my top 10 favorite books. I re-read them every time I disappoint myself.</p>

<h2 id="ii">II</h2>

<p>A limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing away
the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never
return.</p>

<hr />

<p>Through not observing what is in the mind of another man has seldom been seen
to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movement of their own minds
must of necessity be unhappy.</p>

<h2 id="iii">III</h2>

<p>We must make haste then, not only because we are daily nearer to death, but
also because the conception of things and the understanding of them cease
first.</p>

<hr />

<p>Do not waste the remainder of thy life in thoughts about others, when thou dost
not refer thy thoughts to some object of common utility.</p>

<hr />

<p>A man should use himself to think of those things only about which if one
should suddenly ask, What hast thou now in thy thoughts? With perfect openness
thou mightest, immediately answer, This or That;</p>

<hr />

<p>Always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe
this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value
everything has with reference to the whole.</p>

<h2 id="iv">IV</h2>

<p>Let thy principles be brief and fundamental.</p>

<hr />

<p>Change thy opinion, if there is any one at hand who sets thee right and moves
thee from any opinion. But this change of opinion must proceed only from a
certain persuasion, as of what is just or of common advantage, and the like,
not because it appears pleasant or brings reputation.</p>

<hr />

<p>Many grains of frankincense on the same altar: one falls before, another falls
after; but it makes no difference.</p>

<hr />

<p>Within ten days thou wilt seem a god to those to whom thou art now a beast and
an ape, if thou wilt return to thy principles and the worship of reason.</p>

<hr />

<p>How much trouble he avoids who does not look to see what his neighbour says or
does or thinks, but only to what he does himself, that it may be just and pure;
or as Agathon says, look not round at the depraved morals of others, but run
straight along the line without deviating from it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Do what is necessary, and whatever the reason of the animal which is naturally
social requires, and as it requires. For this brings not only the tranquility
which comes from doing well, but also that which comes from doing few things.
For the greatest part of what we say and do being unnecessary, if a man takes
this away, he will have more leisure and less uneasiness. Accordingly on every
occasion a man should ask himself, Is this one of the unnecessary things? Now a
man should take away not only unnecessary acts, but also, unnecessary thoughts,
for thus superfluous acts will not follow after.</p>

<hr />

<p>Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is
remembered.</p>

<hr />

<p>Everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be.</p>

<h2 id="v">V</h2>

<p>Judge every word and deed which are according to nature to be fit for thee; and
be not diverted by the blame which follows from any people nor by their words,
but if a thing is good to be done or said, do not consider it unworthy of thee.
For those persons have their peculiar leading principle and follow their
peculiar movement; which things do not thou regard, but go straight on,
following thy own nature and the common nature; and the way of both is one.</p>

<hr />

<p>Be not disgusted, nor discouraged, nor dissatisfied, if thou dost not succeed
in doing everything according to right principles; but when thou bast failed,
return back again; [&hellip;] and do not return to philosophy as if she were a
master, but act like those who have sore eyes and apply a bit of sponge and
egg.</p>

<hr />

<p>Art thou angry with him whose armpits stink? Art thou angry with him whose
mouth smells foul? What good will this danger do thee? He has such a mouth, he
has such arm-pits: it is necessary that such an emanation must come from such
things- but the man has reason, it will be said, and he is able, if he takes
pain, to discover wherein he offends- I wish thee well of thy discovery. Well
then, and thou hast reason: by thy rational faculty stir up his rational
faculty; show him his error, admonish him. For if he listens, thou wilt cure
him, and there is no need of anger.</p>

<h2 id="vi">VI</h2>

<p>How cruel it is not to allow men to strive after the things which appear to
them to be suitable to their nature and profitable! And yet in a manner thou
dost not allow them to do this, when thou art vexed because they do wrong. For
they are certainly moved towards things because they suppose them to be
suitable to their nature and profitable to them.- But it is not so.- Teach them
then, and show them without being angry.</p>

<hr />

<p>Accustom thyself to attend carefully to what is said by another, and as much as
it is possible, be in the speaker&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<h2 id="vii">VII</h2>

<p>Let not future things disturb thee, for thou wilt come to them, if it shall be
necessary, having with thee the same reason which now thou usest for present
things.</p>

<hr />

<p>Think not so much of what thou hast not as of what thou hast: but of the things
which thou hast select the best, and then reflect how eagerly they would have
been sought, if thou hadst them not. At the same time however take care that
thou dost not through being so pleased with them accustom thyself to overvalue
them, so as to be disturbed if ever thou shouldst not have them.</p>

<hr />

<p>Indeed in the case of most pains let this remark of Epicurus aid thee, that
pain is neither intolerable nor everlasting, if thou bearest in mind that it
has its limits, and if thou addest nothing to it in imagination.</p>

<hr />

<p>Take care not to feel towards the inhuman, as they feel towards men.</p>

<h2 id="viii">VIII</h2>

<p>Let no man any longer hear thee finding fault with the court life or with thy
own.</p>

<hr />

<p>Enter into every man&rsquo;s ruling faculty; and also let every other man enter into
thine.</p>
