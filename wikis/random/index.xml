      <description>Video Talks  Justice: What&amp;rsquo;s the Right Thing To Do?. Amazing Harvard lecture series on Ethics that got me into the subject. Robert Sapolsky: The Biology of Human Behavior. Stanford lecture series. Are you in control of your decisions and personality? Maybe not as much as you think. Everything is a Remix. &amp;ldquo;There be nothing new, but that which is Hath been before&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (Free) documentary on the history of stealing ideas, and how the current reinterpretation of IP / copyright laws stand in the way of innovation, not help it.</description>

      <description>I was on my regular afternoon bike ride when I noticed a crowd of people sweeping the walkways. I leaned my bike on a tree and went to the first man and asked &amp;ldquo;Why do you sweep?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I sweep because I resign,&amp;rdquo; he said to me.&amp;ldquo;I used to go blue in the face with how dirty these streets were. But it was no use, they paid no attention, and I would go mad each day when upon arriving I would dirty my carpet.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something about learning from a physical object that makes things &amp;ldquo;click&amp;rdquo; better in my head (it has volume, texture; a particular smell); and I doubt I&amp;rsquo;m an oddity in this respect &amp;ndash; the root of this effect may be biological: For example, when recalling some piece of information, often I can remember where &amp;ndash; within some textbook I read half a decade ago &amp;ndash; the subject is explained. And I do mean, a literal, physical &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rdquo;: a page, (a thing,) which at all times can be found tucked somewhere within a physical stack of bound paper, which I can touch and feel; I might even remember where I was sitting (or standing, or lying), as I held that particular book, open at that page, when I studied the subject, and what it felt like to the touch, and how the lighting in the room fell on the paper; maybe I jotted some note on the margin, maybe I spilled tea on the pages before, giving that &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rdquo; its own unique irregular texture and color &amp;ndash; all of which my brain will forever associate with that information.</description>

      <title>Stones</title>

      <description>I was at the lake last Summer. I picked a mossy old bench to sit, when a group of adolescents gathered to throw stones into the water. For an hour they busied around, making loud gestures and arguing over whose stone made the bigger splash. They would try every angle, and then bicker about which one spattered out the widest, or which one sent the water flying the highest, and how could they agree on what they&amp;rsquo;d seen if in a moment it was gone?</description>
