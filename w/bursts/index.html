				<p>The first time he fell in love it was with a girl who always smelled like fresh
laundry, and her name was Anna and it was love at first sight, or not quite so,
because it wasn&rsquo;t really all at once that he fell in love with her, but in
little bursts rather, like the steps up a ladder, or grains of sand piling up at
the bottom end of an hourglass, the first of which was him falling madly in love
with her back, which was all he could see from where he sat, and all he wanted
to see, entranced as he was at that moment by its smooth shape and tender flesh
and by the contours of her spine and ribs, which traced sensuous grooves along
the pink fabric of her tanktop whenever she took a deep breath, or spoke, or
hunched over slightly in order to write something in her notebook, at which
point long locks of black hair&ndash;black like tree branches after a forest
fire&ndash;would fall and unravel, revealing for him, like curtains being fluttered
by a morning breeze, which let slip a first ray of light into the room and wake
the dreamer within from his slumber&ndash; yes, exactly like that, they would fall
and unravel and reveal to him her neck, her perfect neck, he thought, which was
the next thing he fell in love with, followed by her dainty hands, and then the
freckles on her face, which she hated, which he loved, adored, and, this is
true, that very same winter he even fell in love with a certain bubbly noise her
nose was making because she was trying to be as quiet as possible when sniffling
every so often because she had had a cold and a runny nose, so he offered her a
tissue, but really it was just so he could lean close enough to smell her, and
to look into her eyes, which, he thought, gazing, small and dark and rounded,
were like an infinitely dark abyss that gazed also into him, which he knew, of
course, because the only reason he had read that damn book was because he had
seen it poking out of her bag that one time.</p>
