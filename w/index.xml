      <title>A Bug</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Unfinished Sketch / In Progress)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
It happed one day that through a thick-leaved forest wondered I
And in that dark buzzed what I thought an ordinary fly

...

&#34;If not to pester me, foul creature, why fly thus at night?&#34;
&#34;Let me demonstrate,&#34; I heard, and sure enough: a light!
&#34;An ordinary bug I am, invisible, by day;
So when the sun is hid I wake&#34;, it said, and lit my way;
And before soon the stars and moon we spotted merrily.
&#34;What such relief!&#34; I thought, then said, and thanked him heartily;
Then brighter still my wing√®d friend drew geometric shapes:
Shine where you are seen! we sang,
Shine where you are seen!
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>It Sort Of Alliterates</title>

I&#39;m a cheerful ball of clay
See me rolling down the slope
Tumbling forth stochastically
Slowly gathering full shape
My only maker gravity
Molded of some dust and rain
And salt and pressed to solid form
Out of which grass blades cut through
And another and more still
Softening the tumble more
They extend toward the sun
Growing roots that soak and feed
That chip and crack me outside in
Turning clay to dust again
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>My Dearest Zuckerberg #2</title>
      <link>http://noamswebsite.com/w/zuck2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My Dearest Zuckerberg,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the elderly grocerystoreman has lost his mind. Why is it that whenever
I visit his store so that I may purchase one of his goods (puddings by the
pound and junk and spiced killgrinded cow in an addictively unsatisfying stale
orange envelope made of, presumably, wheat, or corn? (The kind that when I bite
on it it sticks to my teeth and stains my palate with thoughts of
factory-cookeries somewhere in a third world country)) UP pops he like a wildly
flankhaired coocoobird, sharp hairy ear and nosetendrils protruding at the dent
of his upper lip reminding one of&amp;hellip; of, DEATH! The shadowy claws of DEATH
protruding from and clawing at the face of a man who can no longer hear or
smell yet insists to do and die in slow motion before my very eyes, each day
wrinkling further in imperceptible ways and in UNMENTIONABLE places, gibbering
an ineffectual recombinant pidgin of tongues that tickle barely my ear so that
here and there I say &amp;ldquo;Ah!&amp;rdquo; and smile simply and there and here he SUDDENLY JABS
me with English and I scramble but, Zuck, off he goes again into the structured
madness of a verbal semiotics which my neural net can interpret only as noise,
white and black and peppered like swirlylocks of a middleaged lothario, slave
still and for one last go to that shriveled greedy chromosome, and why not,
buying pounds for pounds, indiscriminately and without remorse, as he surely
was some many lustless lustra prior, married, which he must remember fondly
whenever a goodsome pair of gelatinous mounds tingle his doorbell? Where was he
before and what was he doing there and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could understand Cantonese too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Pair Of Dirty Shoes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A second pair stacked on top. Dirty socks. Dirty shirts. Piles of them.  That
chair I don&amp;rsquo;t even like. Too many cups. A clean bedroom, the bed made. Clean
dishes, one of those pluggable scented candles. His records. My records. Too
much space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Girl On A Train Asks About The Book In My Bag</title>
      <link>http://noamswebsite.com/w/traingirl/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that book you&amp;rsquo;re reading?&amp;rdquo; she asks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Ernest Wattle:&lt;/em&gt; the story of a man who falls in love with the statue of an
ancient goddess.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sounds strange.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Depends how you read it. It&amp;rsquo;s also the story of Almendra, an ancient goddess
who creates a man just so he would love her. But then, through prayer, he
brings her statue to life, but she falls in love with someone else.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quaint-looking pig farm, like something out of a picture book, whizzes across
the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everybody is inventing everybody.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Little Room</title>
      <link>http://noamswebsite.com/w/little_room/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A set of boots halt just behind Little Room door, mark a pensive hollow in the
casted light on Little Room floor, peak an inch or two, bringing with them an
ounce of sunshine more, and Little Room croaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The door shuts behind them; the sun is silenced again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little Room is home to feathered insects; bonsai orchards spring out of cracks
on the floor, on which they perch and feed. A girl, sixteen maybe, lost her
virginity there, by one of those cracks, to a crowd of cackling drunkards,
tickled by the feathered pixies, and she thought it was a magical place, and
she could never go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boots demand a double-shot of Jim from nobody in particular. Another girl,
nineteen, ragged as a doll, but a doll, still, with hair frayed beautifully
like a fractal tuft of burnt shrubbery, offers her body to The Boots, in her
room upstairs, not for his money, just his attention. He takes the drink from
her hand and tosses a coin and immediately forgets she exists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bursts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time he fell in love it was with a girl who always smelled like fresh
laundry, and her name was Anna and it was love at first sight, or not quite so,
because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really all at once that he fell in love with her, but in
little bursts rather, like the steps up a ladder, or grains of sand piling up at
the bottom end of an hourglass, the first of which was him falling madly in love
with her back, which was all he could see from where he sat, and all he wanted
to see, entranced as he was at that moment by its smooth shape and tender flesh
and by the contours of her spine and ribs, which traced sensuous grooves along
the pink fabric of her tanktop whenever she took a deep breath, or spoke, or
hunched over slightly in order to write something in her notebook, at which
point long locks of black hair&amp;ndash;black like tree branches after a forest
fire&amp;ndash;would fall and unravel, revealing for him, like curtains being fluttered
by a morning breeze, which let slip a first ray of light into the room and wake
the dreamer within from his slumber&amp;ndash; yes, exactly like that, they would fall
and unravel and reveal to him her neck, her perfect neck, he thought, which was
the next thing he fell in love with, followed by her dainty hands, and then the
freckles on her face, which she hated, which he loved, adored, and, this is
true, that very same winter he even fell in love with a certain bubbly noise her
nose was making because she was trying to be as quiet as possible when sniffling
every so often because she had had a cold and a runny nose, so he offered her a
tissue, but really it was just so he could lean close enough to smell her, and
to look into her eyes, which, he thought, gazing, small and dark and rounded,
were like an infinitely dark abyss that gazed also into him, which he knew, of
course, because the only reason he had read that damn book was because he had
seen it poking out of her bag that one time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Wouldn&#39;t Mind Floating Downstream</title>
      <link>http://noamswebsite.com/w/downstream/</link>

      <description>&lt;pre&gt;
&#34;I would not mind floating downstream;
End up among the fish and whales.

Of the ocean waters, dark and deep,
I&#39;m not afraid, for I do know
That, once you&#39;ve lived among the corals,
The muddy currents, pebbles and rocks,
And parlous contours of the stream
Against whose tide you&#39;d rather swim
Are banes you&#39;ll gladly leave behind;

For deep at sea you&#39;re not confined
By rocks and edges that grind and rasp--
The river&#39;s water may be sweet,
But just as sweet, the river&#39;s shallow;
I&#39;d rather down its torrent follow,
Follow to the salted sea.&#34;

(At this you quickly sipped your tea)

&#34;Yes, in the sea I&#39;ll freely trace
The peaceful ebbs of open space,
More free than any shallow stream;
As free as logic in a dream.&#34;

Again you sipped, and leaned, and laughed,
Then played a moment with your scarf;
And I suspect you did agree.
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;They tear up the room, they jest and joke around, and I&amp;rsquo;m that much closer to
not being here anymore; but when you have no friends, everyone is your friend.
They gist and jitter, like little bugs, they bump into me, sit by my side, lean
on me, kiss me, and just as quickly they leave; when I hold one it feels fuzzy,
like an idea.  &amp;ldquo;Will you ever let me go?&amp;rdquo; No, never; I&amp;rsquo;ll hold you in my arms
forever&amp;ndash; and it&amp;rsquo;s not there anymore. If you let them go, they&amp;rsquo;ll be yours
forever, like air you&amp;rsquo;ve already exhaled. &amp;ldquo;Do you love me?&amp;rdquo; Well, when you&amp;rsquo;re
not in love, you&amp;rsquo;re in love with everybody.  I write it all down, scratch
things out, add things in; I make many mistakes you&amp;rsquo;ll never know about, sink
into the couch and make easy conversation with pieces of lint and loose change;
I clumsily stitch words onto people and people onto words. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m your ideal of
an ideal woman,&amp;rdquo; I make one say, taking a long drag off someone else&amp;rsquo;s
cigarette, I kind of shoot an askant smile, trying to look smart or at least
aloof and not stupid.  Bumping into me, sitting by my side, leaning on me, she
smiles.  &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of dogs,&amp;rdquo; I tell her: &amp;ldquo;I was bitten when I was a toddler.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t painful, but some fears kind of stick like that and you can&amp;rsquo;t get rid
of them. I wanted to pet it; I kept hesitating too, but the guy told me &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t
worry, he won&amp;rsquo;t bite&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash; so I petted it, and sure enough it bit me.&amp;rdquo; She presses
her body, swaddled in a fuzzy sweater, closer against me, I hold her head tight
against my chest, her hair glows redder than the tip of the cigarette; I make
her say more things, pithy things, terse things, non sequiturs, redundancies,
allusions; her skin burns the tips of my fingers and chars my tongue.  Casually
she says &amp;ldquo;I think you&amp;rsquo;ll fall in love with me.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;O yea?&amp;rdquo; I chuckle, running the
lank of her hair through my fingers. She says, &amp;ldquo;O yes; I have you all figured
out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write down the conversation before I&amp;rsquo;m any part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stop that,&amp;rdquo; she palms my notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to get her hand out of the way, I try to explain to her that if I don&amp;rsquo;t
write this down it&amp;rsquo;ll really happen, but it&amp;rsquo;s too late because she leans in and
kisses me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;pre&gt;
Roomly I dejected your enter.
We bedded on your sit;
Did you kiss to want me?
I wanted to bad you kissly, sure.
I loved you to make want to too.
Real buttly, I felt near you just to get lucky.
And your lovely open looked so wide, sweet eyes.
Your sweet strawberry tastes like a juicy mouth.
O, I&#39;m so long for you, I how in pain!
And I want to proclaim my love for my pride, but you swallow.
Darling, I am so in you, with love.
And every time you stop, my heart looks at me.

Dear love, this me for you will be the death of God.
So leave, don&#39;t ever please me.

    Words don&#39;t listen
     Words don&#39;t talk
     Don&#39;t do nothing
    You write them down
They just kind of sit there
