      <description>The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness. This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first appears he is a protector.
When the tyrant has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some war or other, in order that the people may require a leader.</description>

      <description>On Liberty in its entirety is available here for free here: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm
Main Reasons For Protecting Free Speech JS Mill presents the reader with four principal arguments. It should be of note that he does not appeal to man&amp;rsquo;s natural right to free expression, or romantic notions of &amp;ldquo;Truth&amp;rdquo;: Mill is solely concerned about the far-reaching societal consequences of impeding dissent. The four arguments are as follows:
 First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true.</description>

      <description>On The Effectiveness Of Bad Men  More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will.
 The Purpose Of Nonviolent Direct Action  I must confess that I am not afraid of the word &amp;ldquo;tension.&amp;rdquo; I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth.</description>

      <description>Health  In general, nine—tenths of our happiness depends upon health alone. With health, everything is a source of pleasure; without it, nothing else, whatever it may be, is enjoyable; even the other personal blessings, &amp;ndash; a great mind, a happy temperament &amp;ndash; are degraded and dwarfed for want of it. [&amp;hellip;] It follows from all this that the greatest of follies is to sacrifice health for any other kind of happiness, whatever it may be, for gain, advancement, learning or fame, let alone, then, for fleeting sensual pleasures.</description>

      <description> When the enemy is making a false movement we must take good care not to interrupt him.
  You must not fight too often with one enemy, or you will teach him all your art of war.

      <description>Selections from his meditations (Available here for free. One of my top 10 favorite books. I re-read them every time I disappoint myself.
II  A limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return.
  Through not observing what is in the mind of another man, a man has seldom been seen to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movement of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.</description>

      <description>Anti-Semitism (In letter to his sister.)
 Now it has gone so far that I have to defend myself hand and foot against people who confuse me with these anti-Semitic canaille; after my own sister, my former sister, and after Widemann more recently have given the impetus to this most dire of all confusions. After I read the name Zarathustra in the anti-Semitic Correspondence my forbearance came to an end.</description>

      <description>Enchiridion X  On the occasion of every accident (event) that befalls you, remember to turn to yourself and inquire what power you have for turning it to use. If you see a fair man or a fair woman, you will find that the power to resist is temperance (continence). If labour (pain) be presented to you, you will find that it is endurance. If it be abusive words, you will find it to be patience.</description>

      <description>Understanding  When I am working, I am not interested in how my work might affect people. [And when I am finished] I am finished. What is important to me is to understand. For me, writing is a matter of seeking this understanding … certain things get formulated. […] What is important to me is the process of thought itself.
  You ask about the effects of my work on others.</description>

      <description>Spoken / Video Buckley Debate At Cambridge
 &amp;ldquo;Baldwin&amp;rsquo;s Nigger&amp;rdquo;
 Debate With Malcolm X (Audio Only (Can anyone find the full recording? It cuts out at the end.))
 Sentimentality  Sentimentality, the ostentatious parading of excessive and spurious emotion, is the mark of dishonesty, the inability to feel; the wet eyes of the sentimentalist betray his aversion to experience, his fear of life, his arid heart; and it is always, therefore, the signal of secret and violent inhumanity, the mark of cruelty.</description>

      <description>Video Talks  Justice: What&amp;rsquo;s the Right Thing To Do?. Provocative Harvard lecture series on Ethics. Robert Sapolsky: The Biology of Human Behavior. Stanford lecture series. Are you in control of your decisions and personality? Maybe not as much as you think. Everything is a Remix. &amp;ldquo;There be nothing new, but that which is Hath been before&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (Free) documentary on the history of stealing ideas, and how the current reinterpretation of IP / copyright laws stand in the way of innovation, not help it.</description>

      <description>I was on my regular afternoon bike ride when I noticed a crowd of people sweeping the walkways. I leaned my bike on a tree and went to the first man and asked &amp;ldquo;Why do you sweep?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I sweep because I resign,&amp;rdquo; he said to me.&amp;ldquo;I used to go blue in the face with how dirty these streets were. But it was no use, they paid no attention, and I would go mad each day when upon arriving I would dirty my carpet.</description>

      <description>On Stoicism  Human life the Stoics appear to have considered as a game of great skill; in which, however, there was a mixture of chance [&amp;hellip;] In such games the stake is commonly a trifle, and the whole pleasure of the game arises from playing well, from playing fairly, and playing skilfully. If notwithstanding all his skill, however, the good player should, by the influence of chance, happen to lose, the loss ought to be a matter, rather of merriment, than of serious sorrow.</description>
