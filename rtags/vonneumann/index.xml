      <description>When we talk mathematics, we may be discussing a secondary language built on the primary language of the nervous system.
  If one has really technically penetrated a subject, things that previously seemed in complete contrast, might be purely mathematical transformations of each other.
 From Lectures On Self-Replicating Automata (1948?)  An automaton cannot be separated from the milieu to which it responds.
  It is therefore quite possible that we are not too far from the limits of complication which can be achieved in artificial automata without really fundamental insights into a theory of information, although one should be very careful with such statements because they can sound awfully ridiculous 5 years later.</description>
