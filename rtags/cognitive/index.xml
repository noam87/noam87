      <description>Selections from his meditations (Available here for free. One of my top 10 favorite books. I re-read them every time I disappoint myself.
II  A limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return.
  Through not observing what is in the mind of another man, a man has seldom been seen to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movement of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.</description>

      <description>Anti-Semitism (In letter to his sister.)
 Now it has gone so far that I have to defend myself hand and foot against people who confuse me with these anti-Semitic canaille; after my own sister, my former sister, and after Widemann more recently have given the impetus to this most dire of all confusions. After I read the name Zarathustra in the anti-Semitic Correspondence my forbearance came to an end.</description>

      <description>Enchiridion X  On the occasion of every accident (event) that befalls you, remember to turn to yourself and inquire what power you have for turning it to use. If you see a fair man or a fair woman, you will find that the power to resist is temperance (continence). If labour (pain) be presented to you, you will find that it is endurance. If it be abusive words, you will find it to be patience.</description>

      <description>He who floats with the current, who does not guide himself according to higher principles, who has no ideal, no convictions, &amp;ndash; such a man is a mere article of the world&amp;rsquo;s furniture &amp;ndash; a thing moved, instead of a living and moving being &amp;ndash; an echo, not a voice. The man who has no inner life is the slave of his surroundings, as the barometer is the obedient servant of the air at rest, and the weathercock the humble servant of the air in motion.</description>

      <description>The Difference Of Wit And Judgement  Men who have a great deal of wit, and prompt memories, have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason. For wit lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together with quickness and variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy; judgment, on the contrary, lies quite on the other side, in separating carefully, one from another, ideas wherein can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by similitude, and by affinity to take one thing for another.</description>

      <description>Video Talks  Justice: What&amp;rsquo;s the Right Thing To Do?. Provocative Harvard lecture series on Ethics. Robert Sapolsky: The Biology of Human Behavior. Stanford lecture series. Are you in control of your decisions and personality? Maybe not as much as you think. Everything is a Remix. &amp;ldquo;There be nothing new, but that which is Hath been before&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (Free) documentary on the history of stealing ideas, and how the current reinterpretation of IP / copyright laws stand in the way of innovation, not help it.</description>

      <description> About Him  He was not a very careful person as a mathematician. He made a lot of mistakes. But he made mistakes in a good direction. I tried to imitate him. But I’ve realized that it’s very difficult to make good mistakes.

      <description>On Stoicism  Human life the Stoics appear to have considered as a game of great skill; in which, however, there was a mixture of chance [&amp;hellip;] In such games the stake is commonly a trifle, and the whole pleasure of the game arises from playing well, from playing fairly, and playing skilfully. If notwithstanding all his skill, however, the good player should, by the influence of chance, happen to lose, the loss ought to be a matter, rather of merriment, than of serious sorrow.</description>

      <description>Is it courage to, or incapacity not-to?
 The creative person has the courage to experience opposites of his nature and to attempt some reconciliation of them in an individuated expression of himself.

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something about learning from a physical object that makes things &amp;ldquo;click&amp;rdquo; better in my head (it has volume, texture; a particular smell); and I doubt I&amp;rsquo;m an oddity in this respect &amp;ndash; the root of this effect may be biological: For example, when recalling some piece of information, often I can remember where &amp;ndash; within some textbook I read half a decade ago &amp;ndash; the subject is explained. And I do mean, a literal, physical &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rdquo;: a page, (a thing,) which at all times can be found tucked somewhere within a physical stack of bound paper, which I can touch and feel; I might even remember where I was sitting (or standing, or lying), as I held that particular book, open at that page, when I studied the subject, and what it felt like to the touch, and how the lighting in the room fell on the paper; maybe I jotted some note on the margin, maybe I spilled tea on the pages before, giving that &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rdquo; its own unique irregular texture and color &amp;ndash; all of which my brain will forever associate with that information.</description>

      <description>I was at the lake last Summer. I picked a mossy old bench to sit, when a group of adolescents gathered to throw stones into the water. For an hour they busied around, making loud gestures and arguing over whose stone made the bigger splash. They would try every angle, and then bicker about which one spattered out the widest, or which one sent the water flying the highest, and how could they agree on what they&amp;rsquo;d seen if in a moment it was gone?</description>
