      <description>On The Effectiveness Of Bad Men  More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will.
 This observation rings true to this day, and on almost every social domain. It&amp;rsquo;s truly disheartening, the effectiveness with which the far right and neo-liberal centre have managed to run their political operations and unify their base, and with laser-focus dismantle social and environmental safety nets, metastasize state militarism and police impunity, and pervert our democracies in such a way that they seem now practically engineered to benefit the ultra-wealthy.</description>
