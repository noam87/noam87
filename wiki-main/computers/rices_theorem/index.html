<p>Rice&rsquo;s theorem can be stated thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every non-trivial semantic property of a program is undecidable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before we prove the theorem, let&rsquo;s break down that statement:</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="semantic-property">&ldquo;Semantic Property&rdquo;</h3>

<p>A ssemantic property is a property of the language, <em>not the machine that is
computing it</em>. For example, this is a semantic property of a language:</p>

<ul>
<li>All strings in language $L$ are of the form $1^n0^n$.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a semantic property:</p>

<ul>
<li>It takes my program $n$ steps to generate the first 100 strings in $L$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the importance of differentiating between a semantic property and not:</p>

<ul>
<li>The halting problem is actually decidable for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_bounded_automaton">Linear Bouned Automata</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="non-trivial">&ldquo;Non-Trivial&rdquo;</h3>

<p>A trivial property is a property that either all languages have or no language
has. A non-trivial property is everything else.</p>

<h3 id="undecidable">&ldquo;Undecidable&rdquo;</h3>

<p>A program can either <strong>accept</strong>, <strong>reject</strong>, or <strong>run forever</strong>. If a program
reaches an accept or reject state, we say it <strong>halts</strong>.</p>

<p>There are two types of programs: <strong>recognizers</strong> and <strong>deciders</strong>.</p>

<p>A recognizer is a program that can only tell you with certainty when it has
succeeded to solve a problem (reached the accept state). It cannot always tell
you when it has failed (if it goes into an infinite loop, there is no way to
know if it&rsquo;s in a loop, or if it&rsquo;s just taking very long to solve the problem).</p>

<p>A decider is a program that always reaches either accepts or rejects. That is,
you not only know when the problem was solved, but you also know when it was
<em>not</em> solved.</p>

<p>A language is <strong>recognizable</strong> if there exists at least one program that can
recognize it. For example, the following program reconizes $L = \{&ldquo;342&rdquo;\}$ (the
language made up of only the string &ldquo;342&rdquo;):</p>

<ol>
<li>Read input.</li>
<li>If input == &ldquo;342&rdquo; print &ldquo;accept&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Else return to step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>This program <em>recognizes</em> $L$, but it does not <em>decide</em> $L$: if the input is in
$L$, it accepts, but if it&rsquo;s not, then it will run forever, and you will never
know whether the input was not in $L$ or the program is just taking a long
time.</p>

<p>A language is <strong>decidable</strong> if there exists a program that can decide it. All
decidable languages are also recognizable. Here is a program that decides $L$:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read input.</li>
<li>If input == &ldquo;342&rdquo; print &ldquo;accept&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Else print &ldquo;input rejected&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-halting-problem">The Halting Problem</h2>

<p>Take the following language:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$HALT_{ TM } = \{ \langle M, w \rangle | M$
is a program and $M$ halts on input $w \}$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember, a program is itself just a string: any program can be written down as
a description, say an <code>.rb</code> file, and that file can be used as an input for
another program (or itself!). So $HALT_{ TM }$ is a language that consists of
all programs $M$ and inputs $w$ such that $M$ halts on $w$.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t prove it in this post, but, as it turns out, $HALT_{ TM }$ is
undecidable. Meaning it is not possible to write a program that decides whether
an algorithm halts.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we can finally prove Rice&rsquo;s theorem:</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="rice-s-theorem">Rice&rsquo;s Theorem</h2>

<p>Recall the theorem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every non-trivial semantic property of a program is undecidable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet another way of stating this is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The language $P_{ TM }$, described below, is undecidable:
$P_{ TM } = \{ \langle M \rangle | M$ is a program and $L(M)$ has
non-trivial property $P \}$. Where $L(M)$ means &ldquo;The language of $M$&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, for example, it is not possible to write a program $R $ that takes as its
input another program $M$ and decides whether the language of $M$ is regular
(that is, if $M$ can be simplified and represented as a finite automation).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>

<p>We can prove Rice&rsquo;s theorem by contradiction. We will show that <strong>if</strong> $P_{ TM
}$ is decidable <strong>then</strong> so is $HALT_{ TM }$.  Since we know that $ HALT_{ TM
}$ is undecidable, then $P_{ TM }$ must be undecidable too.</p>

<p>Assume that $P$ is some non-trivial semantic property and that it is possible
to write a program $R$ that decides $P_{ TM }$. Here is how we could solve the
halting problem with that program:</p>

<p>First, we write a program $T$ such that $\langle T \rangle $ is in $P_{ TM }$.
Because $P$ is non-trivial, such a program must exist.</p>

<p>Take input $\langle M, w \rangle$ and use it to write a program $M_w$that
takes $x$ as its input and does the following:</p>

<p><strong>$M_w $:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Run $M$ on input $w$. If $M$ halts, move on to step 2.  2. Run $T$ on $x$. Accept if $T$ accepts, and reject if $T$ rejects.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the clever part. <em>We don&rsquo;t actually have to run $M_w$</em>:</p>

<p>All we need to know is that, if we <em>were</em> to run $M_w$, there are two possible
outcomes:</p>

<ul>
<li>$M$ halts on input $w$, in which case $M_w$ reaches step 2.</li>
<li>$M$ never halts and never reaches step 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>But note that, if $M$ halts on $w$, then step 2 is simply to run $T$, which
means that <strong>when $M$ halts on $w$, $ \langle M_w \rangle$is in $ P_{ TM
}$.</strong></p>

<p>So, if we were to run $R$ with input $\langle M_w \rangle$, it would be able
to tell us whether it is in $P_{ TM }$, and that in turn would tell us if $M$
halts on $w$.</p>

<p>But this would mean that we could solve the halting problem, which we know  is
not possible.</p>
