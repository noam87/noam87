      <description>For any data type that requires N bytes, its starting address should be a multiple of N. In most x86 processors the memory interface is designed to read/write blocks that are 8 or 16 bytes long2.
 Unaligned memory accesses occur when you try to read N bytes of data starting from an address that is not evenly divisible by N (i.e. addr % N != 0). For example, reading 4 bytes of data from address 0x10004 is fine, but reading 4 bytes of data from address 0x10005 would be an unaligned memory access 6.</description>
